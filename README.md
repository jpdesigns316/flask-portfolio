# Portfolio Website Builder
This is a solo project to create a website builder to make a portfolio site using
Flask and SQLAlchemy libriaries. This uses the [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/)
free Bootstrap theme and using the [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)
templates.



You will need to modify the portfolio.conf file with your configurations before you move it to '/etc/apache2/sites-available'
You will need to modify config.py with the type of database you are using and to update it with your info.


To Do:
- Add a section which allows a user to choose a file and upload it.
- Change location of the static and templates to S3.
- Create a way for user to configure info from a from instead of modifying config.py
- Make project open source after initial design is complete.
- Allow configuration changes to the colors.
- Have other templates to be able to be imported.
- Open to suggestions
